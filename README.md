# Ithadev's environment files

This repository stores the dotfiles and configuration files for my development environments. It also includes a command-line tool built using [`bashly`](https://github.com/DannyBen/bashly), a framework for generating Bash command-line tools. The tool provides a streamlined way to manage and apply these configurations.
